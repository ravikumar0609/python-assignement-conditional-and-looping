#1.Write a program to check if a given year is a leap year or not.
#Leap year: a year is said to be a leap year, if the year is exactly
#divisible by 4 but and not divisible by 100

year = int(input("Enter the year"))
if (year%4==0)&(year%100!=0):
    print(year,"is a leap year")
else:

output:
Enter the year2004
2004 is a leap year

#2.Write a program to check whether a triangle is valid or not if angles are given. Valid Triangle: 
#Sum of all the angles should be 180. All the angles should be greater than zero

angle3 = int(input("enter angle3 "))
sum=0
if (angle1>0)&(angle2>0):
    if angle3>0:
        sum=angle1+angle2+angle3

output:
enter angle1 60
enter angle2 60
enter angle3 60
given angles will make a triangle


#3.Write a program to input electricity unit charge and calculate the total electricity bill according to the given conditions:

#- For the first 50 units Rs. 0.50/unit
#- For the next 100 units Rs. 0.75/unit
#- For the next 100 units Rs. 1.20/unit
#- For unit above 250 Rs. 1.50/unit

#Also, an additional surcharge of 20% should be added to the bill.
